abstract: Nonignorable missingness and noncompliance can occur even in well-designed randomized experiments making the intervention effect that the experiment was designed to estimate nonidentifiable. Nonparametric causal bounds provide a way to narrow the range of possible values for a nonidentifiable causal effect with minimal assumptions. We derive novel bounds for the causal risk difference for a binary outcome and intervention in randomized experiments with nonignorable missingness caused by a variety of mechanisms and with or without noncompliance. We illustrate the use of the proposed bounds in our motivating data example of peanut consumption on the development of peanut allergies in infants.

summary: Nonignorable missingness and noncompliance can occur even in well-designed randomized experiments making the intervention effect that the experiment was designed to estimate nonidentifiable. Nonparametric causal bounds provide a way to narrow the range of possible values for a nonidentifiable causal effect with minimal assumptions. We derive novel bounds for the causal risk difference for a binary outcome and intervention in randomized experiments with nonignorable missingness caused by a variety of mechanisms and with or without noncompliance. We illustrate the use of the proposed bounds in our motivating data example of peanut consumption on the development of peanut allergies in infants.
